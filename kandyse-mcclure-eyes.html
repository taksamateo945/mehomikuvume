Kaia rejoined the remainder of her team and Mat Preacher, who was bringing sandwiches to the front-line wildfire fighters, after safely delivering the baby and administering life-saving CPR. After engaging in some enjoyable small conversation, the two parted ways. But in Season 5, Jack warns Preach, "You never know when the love of your life is going to walk right into this bar," and naturally, Kaia did just that.</p><p>After Kaia played by Kandyse McClure sat on the bar and swung her feet over, the two had a shot of tequila and then held hands. And the following morning, she and Preacher were both awake in what she delightfully describes as his s*x attic conveniently located above the bar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiimqaUrsCmecycmqWtopp6psXErGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html&text=Virgin%20River%20Casts%20Physical%20Appearance%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html&title=Virgin%20River%20Casts%20Physical%20Appearance%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html&title=Virgin%20River%20Casts%20Physical%20Appearance%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html&title=Virgin%20River%20Casts%20Physical%20Appearance%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkandyse-mcclure-eyes.html&description=Virgin%20River%20Casts%20Physical%20Appearance%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cheese-whose-rind-is-typically-eaten-crossword-clue-universal-answer-1167254.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="*Cheese whose rind is typically eaten Crossword Clue Universal Answer">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./super-excited-in-slang-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Super-excited in slang">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
