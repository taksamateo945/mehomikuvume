But the challenge here is, the better the school, the more expensive it will be. Looking at the poor and below-standard conditions of our public schools today, these private schools are getting much more patronage than one may ever imagine not minding the poor economic condition in the country. Once parents are able to afford any of the ones available, they do not hesitate to withdraw their kids from the public schools and enrol them in private ones.</p><p>But the major thing we want to point out in this article is that there are various grades of private schools. While some parents are struggling to provide a few thousand to settle their children’s&nbsp;school fees, others are busy, splashing millions on theirs. It may not have crossed your wildest imagination that there are secondary schools in Nigeria where tuition fees run in millions of Naira and thousands of US Dollars. These schools are exclusively meant for the rich, who are of course the only people who can afford them.</p><h2><strong>Most Expensive Secondary Schools in Nigeria</strong></h2><h3><strong>23.

It is a full co-educational private boarding school, with teaching and supervision from members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), and specially trained and dedicated lay teachers. The school is located in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria and situated on a 28.5-hectare site in the village of Gidan Mangoro.</p><p>The school provides an atmosphere conducive to focused learning. They charge as much as N2,800,000 per student. Loyola Jesuit College is one of the most sought-after secondary schools in Nigeria. The school is very selective when it comes to admitting new students, making it difficult for many people to school there. For LJC, we’ll say, it’s not only about the cost, but the much-cherished quality education is also certain.</p><h3><strong>8.&nbsp;Meadow Hall, Lagos –&nbsp;N3 million</strong></h3><p><strong>Address:&nbsp;Elegushi Beach Road, By the 4th Roundabout, Lagos-Epe Express Rd, Lekki.</strong></p><p><strong>Website: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>www.meadowhallschool.org</a></strong></p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/meadowhall.jpg alt=meadowhall width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Mrs Kehinde Nwani founded the Meadow Hall Educational Group in 2002.&nbsp;Meadow Hall Group seeks to provide through its subsidiaries opportunities for children to develop in all areas and be able to fully give expression to their unique talents and intelligence, reaching their highest potential.&nbsp;Meadow Hall School is focused on grooming life-long learners and building a learning organisation conversant with the use of 21st Century methodologies and strategies.

Greensprings School is a member of the International Schools Curriculum Project (ISCP), Association of International Schools in Africa (AISA) and Association for the Advancement of International Education (AAIE). In addition to being recognized locally with the necessary approval and accreditation to run as an educational establishment in Nigeria by the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Greensprings School is accredited by The Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation (CITA), an agency involved in improving standards in schools across the world through the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the USA.&nbsp;The fees which are left at a considerable prize of N3 million-plus annually for a boarding student and N1,925,200 annually for day students include a registration which is once, tuition, textbooks, school and house uniforms, PTA levy, caution fee, etc.</p><h3><strong>6.&nbsp;Day Waterman College, Abeokuta – N3.7 million</strong></h3><p><strong>Website:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=345d5a525b745043571a5b46531a5a53>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Day-Waterman-College1.jpg alt=Day-Waterman-College width=1026 height=733 sizes="(max-width: 1026px) 100vw, 1026px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong></p><p>Just as we said earlier, the 3 popular cities in Nigeria are not in an absolute monopoly of these expensive schools. With the look of things, and the high quest for quality education, this kind of schools will soon be scattered all over the country. You will find Day Waterman College along&nbsp;Abeokuta – Sagamu Expressway,&nbsp;Asu Village Road, Abeokuta – Ogun State, Nigeria. It is a modern co-educational boarding school designed to provide an exciting learning environment for secondary school children. The&nbsp;environment offers world-class facilities, a natural, peaceful and focused setting.</p><p>One of the things that make the school not yet known to so many people is definitely the cost. You should never forget the fact that training a child in school does not mean providing the tuition only. There are so many other things that have to be taken care of for the general welfare of the child which may as well cost as much as the tuition. Well, it’ll take just a few millions to meet up with the demands of Day Waterman college.</p><h3><strong>5.
