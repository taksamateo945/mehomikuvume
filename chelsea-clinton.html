Her name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song, “Chelsea Morning”, Bill remarked, “If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Family Member</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On January 20, 1993, the day of her father’s first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename “Energy”.

People decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, People’ s managing editor, affirmed the magazine’s sensitivity to the Clintons’ concerns but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was “an eyewitness to family drama and historical events” and thus “a valid journalistic subject”. The article, entitled “Grace Under Fire”, was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.</p><h2>Who is Chelsea Clinton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong> married to <strong>Marc Mezvinsky </strong>.
