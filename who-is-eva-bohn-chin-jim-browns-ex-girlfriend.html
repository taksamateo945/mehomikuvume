While a few of them were peaceful, many others, including his relationship with Eva, were filled with scandals, toxicity, allegations and counter-allegations.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Eva Bohn-Chin’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><span><strong>AGE:</strong> 76 Years Old</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> 29th December 1946</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> German</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Capricorn</span></li><li><span><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> German-Jamaican</span></li></ul><h2><strong>Eva Bohn-Chin Was Born 76 Years Ago</strong></h2><p>Eva Bohn-Chin was b<span>orn in Germany.

She was born Eva Marie Bohn-Chinon on the 29th of December 1946, which makes her currently 76 years old.</span></p><p><span>Other than this, further details about her family background and early life are not known to the public. Also, information about her educational history is not accessible, but it is believed she is a high school graduate. </span>Eva gained public attention and media recognition for her romance with Jim Brown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Eva-bon.png><p>But besides that, she is known to be a fashion model and influencer. She thrived in the modeling industry during her time, although details of her career endeavors and the brands she worked with are not recorded.</p><h2><strong>What Happened Between Eva Bohn-Chin and Jim Brown?</strong></h2><p>Eva and Jim Brown started dating in 1968, although it is not known exactly where and when they met for the first time. At this time, she was 22 years old while Jim was 32. It is, however, known that Jim’s first wife Sue Brown had just sued for a divorce citing “gross neglect.” They were still living together but processing their divorce case when he met Eva, and they started a relationship.</p><p>At first, their relationship blossomed and it seemed like a happily ever kind of love. They were seen together at events and other public ceremonies. Eva was very supportive of Jim’s career and was usually spotted cheering him in the field. However, this was not after a few months later when news began to make rounds that their relationship was getting toxic.</p><p>In the same year they started dating, precisely on the 9th of June, one of their neighbors in Hollywood overheard an argument in Jim’s apartment and immediately dialed 911. The cops swiftly responded to the call and upon their arrival, they found Eva semi-conscious beneath the balcony of Jim’s West Hollywood second-floor apartment. They transported her to USC County Medical Center for prompt medical attention.</p><p>She was later transferred to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital for further care and evaluation. The actual circumstance or what they were arguing about that led to this incident was not disclosed but it portrayed that the duo had been facing challenges in their relationship even before that particular day. Meanwhile, Brown was arrested and faced a series of allegations including an accusation of throwing her off the balcony.</p><p>He was charged with multiple offenses including felony battery against a law enforcement officer, assault with the intention to cause murder, and obstructing the legal process. He first got released on a $12,500 bail set and his charges were later changed to resisting a deputy with a fine of $300. This was after Eva dropped his charge of assault with intent to commit murder. The then 22-year-old would reveal that she fell from the balcony when the cops arrived.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Jim Brown’s Ex-girlfriend Now?</strong></h2><p>Being an elegant woman with a captivating blend of beauty inherited from her Jamaican father and German mother, Bohn-Chin in her own right was able to make a name for herself in the American modeling scene. However, it won’t be a surprise that the younger generation of models may not be familiar with her because she is now retired, as she is 76 years old.</p><p>Eva Bohn-Chin’s name resonates well with the older generation of models and significantly with millions of American pro football fans, thanks to her publicized relationship with Jim Brown. However, the former celebrity partner appears to be living entirely away from the limelight ever since. She does not have an active presence on any social media platform and is not seen at any public events.</p><p>According to limited information, she currently lives in California, United States of America, though what she is precisely up to is not public knowledge. Indeed, her toxic relationship with Jim Brown was precisely what gave her the height of public recognition she sustains to date, even more than other women the NFL star dated.</p><h2><strong>Her Ex, Jim Brown, was Notorious For Scandalous Relationships and Affairs with Women</strong></h2><p>Eva Bohn-Chin’s ex-boyfriend, Jim Brown is a famous American football fullback, civil rights activist, and actor who played for the Cleveland Browns in the NFL from 1957 through 1965. However, notable is the fact that he had a dark side when it comes to domestic violence. “Jim Brown Did Great Things; He Also Beat Women” was once a popular headline for many media outlets and news sites.</p><p>Jim was reportedly arrested at least seven times for assault mainly against women but, he never served any significant jail sentence. In most of the cases, the women involved refused to press charges even after calling the police, just like in Eva’s case. Yet, his stories of violence, especially with women, cannot be ignored. Besides Eva Bohn-Chin, Jim Brown encountered a series of other scandalous affairs with women.</p><p>In 1965, he was arrested in his hotel room for assault and battery against an 18-year-old Brenda Ayres. In 1975, he was convicted of misdemeanor battery for beating and choking his golfing partner, Frank Snow, In 1985, he was charged with raping a 33-year-old woman. However, as the story goes, he was acquitted of all of the charges.</p><p>These are only but a few of his numerous rape and assault cases. In fact, according to several witnesses and victims who were interviewed for <i>Secrets of Playboy,</i> the 2022 documentary series<i>,</i> Jim Brown brutally raped and assaulted numerous women and young girls at the Playboy Mansion from the late 1970s into the 1990s.</p><p>Jim Brown passed away at the age of 87 on 20th May 2023 at his home in Los Angeles, California. He died of natural causes with his wife at his side. Notably, his recent death was the reason his ex-girlfriend Eva surfaced in the limelight despite the fact that their relationship happened many decades ago and had almost been forgotten by the internet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecSvmGaan527bq%2FHoqVmopmieqO%2BzrClrGWVrXqotdGlnauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html&text=Who%20is%20Eva%20Bohn-Chin%2c%20Jim%20Brown%27s%20Ex-girlfriend%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Eva%20Bohn-Chin%2c%20Jim%20Brown%27s%20Ex-girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Eva%20Bohn-Chin%2c%20Jim%20Brown%27s%20Ex-girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Eva%20Bohn-Chin%2c%20Jim%20Brown%27s%20Ex-girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-eva-bohn-chin-jim-browns-ex-girlfriend.html&description=Who%20is%20Eva%20Bohn-Chin%2c%20Jim%20Brown%27s%20Ex-girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fancy-party-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fancy party">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./roseanne-who-received-around-67-000-votes-for-president-in-2012-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roseanne who received around 67 000 votes for president in 2012">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
