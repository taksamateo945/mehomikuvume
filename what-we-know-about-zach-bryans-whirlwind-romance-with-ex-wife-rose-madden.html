Richard and his wife met about seven years before they were married when she worked in music publishing, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The US Sun</a>. At the time, Joyce met her leading man while in attendance at <strong>Ringo Starr</strong>‘s album release party.

Despite not expanding their family, many around them noted how much the two loved each other.&nbsp;<strong>Susie Essman</strong>, who also starred on&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm, called Joyce a “stabilizing” partner for Richard. “Joyce has such a stabilizing effect on him,” she said, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Closer Weekly</a>. “Everybody is looking for that one person in life who will love you unconditionally, and he’s found that with her.”</p><h2 id=what-richard-said-about-joyce-before-his-death>What Richard Said About Joyce Before His Death</h2><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/ngqm6TmC3x</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— Richard Lewis (@TheRichardLewis) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 24, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>During an interview before his death, Richard recalled how he and his wife often spent time with the late actress&nbsp;<strong>Phyllis Diller</strong>. “Phyllis [Diller] was like the mother I never had who loved my work, saw my shows, called me. My wife and I would go to her house often, and she’d take me out to dinner,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>When Richard died in February 2024, his publicist <strong>Jeff Abraham</strong> released a statement on behalf of Joyce. “His wife, Joyce Lapinsky, thanks everyone for all the love, friendship and support and asks for privacy at this time,” he said, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. In the year before his death, Richard revealed that he was retiring to focus on his health. He took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a> in April 2023 and released a video to share the news with his fans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Hey listen, I just wrapped a couple of weeks ago season 12 of ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ and it was just an amazing season and I’m so grateful to be a part of that show,” Richard said. “But you know the last three and a half years, I’ve had sort of a rocky time and people said, ‘I haven’t heard from you, are you still touring?’” He also explained that he had multiple surgeries and was under medical care.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I had four surgeries back to back to back to back, it was incredible, I couldn’t believe it, it was bad luck, but that’s life,” he continued. “I’m finished with stand-up. I’m just focusing on writing and acting. I have Parkinson’s disease but I’m under a doctor’s care and everything is cool. I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog and I love all my friends and my fans. And now you know where it’s been at the last three and a half years.
