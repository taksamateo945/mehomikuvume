Especially right now during COVID-19, it seems like people all over the world are uniting via the internet. You know as terrible as COVID is, it’s something that everyone around the world can relate to. Now United has been uniting different people from different cultures and counties since 2017. Can you speak to that a little bit and how having relationships with people all over the world has offered you new perspective and appreciation for different cultures?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Noah Urrea: </b>“I feel like before I was in Now United, it’s not that I was close-minded, but I didn’t necessarily know how wonderful and beautiful other places in the world are and how incredible their cultures can be. I was lucky enough to travel to some of these countries and it kind of opened my mind to learning about these different cultures. And I think social media is the perfect way to do that. I think that what’s so cool about Now United is that we do a lot of that. We connect a bunch of people from all over the world. And I’ve heard from countless numbers of fans that they met friends and someone from Brazil became friends with someone from Australia because they bonded over Now United and bonded over music.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS:</b> <strong>That’s awesome and just goes to show how important it is for people to get out of their comfort zones and experience other cultures. Is there one experience from visiting another county with Now United that stands out to you?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU: </b>“I feel like every country we go to has something beautiful and unique about it. For me, I personally love fashion. One time we were in Tokyo and we got to go shopping in the streets and see the whole underground fashion scene and it was super cool. That was one of my favorite experiences — shopping and eating ramen for the entire week.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS: </b><strong>So you guys are performing at Walk & Play LA this Saturday. Obviously due to COVID, this event will now take place virtually. How does one go about preparing a virtual performance let alone one that requires the participation of 15 different people in 15 different countries?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU: </b>“You know what, one thing that’s so crazy about Now United is that we always find ways to do things. And we found ways to record ourselves singing live and just mashed it all together. It’s really awesome what we could do that from far away. I’m excited for you guys to see what we prepared.”</span></p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xu_9pJNkU/</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS:</b>&nbsp;<strong>Why is Walk and Play L.A. and it’s goal to celebrate and promote the well-being of children in Los Angeles while raising critical funds to support Children’s Hospital Los Angeles important to you and the members of Now United?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU: </b>“For me personally, it’s local and its always great to support local things. This is like way bigger because we have the opportunity to help save lives. There are all sorts of things going on in the world that are crazy, but Children’s Hospital Los Angeles always seems to be taking such good care of their patients, so the least we can do is help out with this event.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS:</b>&nbsp;<strong>Participants have the option to donate to COVID relief funds as well. Obviously COVID is a terrible disease, but there is so much negativity and sadness in the air right now. I truly believe every cloud has a silver lining. Is there something in the past several months during quarantine that has been your silver lining? Maybe sometime to pause and reflect?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU:</b>&nbsp;“I feel like this time more than ever I’ve been more creative than I have been in the past couple years. Just trying to use this time to make as much art as I can which has been very therapeutic and great for me.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS:</b> <strong>Since we’re Celeb Secrets, I’ll let you after you give us a secret. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a secret, just something fans might not know about you.</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU: </b>“Let&nbsp;me think.&nbsp; I should have been prepared for this question (laughs). This is less of a secret and more of a fun fact… When I was a kid, I played baseball and I was a pitcher. Every time I would pitch, I’d be singing on the mound and do a little dance with my butt. I was like 12-years-old and people would always laugh at me but that’s sort of a little embarrassing fact that not too many people know about me”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>CS:</b> <strong>Was there a song in particular you would sing!?</strong></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>NU: </b>“Oh probably something off the My World 2.0 album.”</span></p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_caroline has-avatar" readability=0><img data-del=avatar alt="Caroline Renezeder" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20/431CF55A-BF3E-4DF6-A4C7-82B0C491C0A2-110x110.png height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Caroline is a west coast correspondent for Celeb Secrets and founder of LA based production company Illuminate Creative Group.
