It was announced in July 2010 that Hines would be joining the cast of the Nickelodeon film based on The Fairly OddParents, A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner! as a human disguise of Wanda, Timmy’s fairy godmother.</p><p>In 2009, Hines starred in the ABC sitcom In the Motherhood. It is loosely an adaptation to the web series. She played Jane. The series was short-lived lasting 5 out of 7 episodes due to low ratings.</p><p>“When the show first came out people from Tallahassee thought, ‘Well, maybe Cheryl got married'”, she recalls of the show’s initial reception. “Sometimes, I do feel like I live two lives.” Hines received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Curb Your Enthusiasm in 2003 and 2006. Speaking about being cast on the show, Hines has said that “Until Curb, I’d done small roles, really small roles. They wanted to cast an unknown actress. It worked in my favor that I hadn’t done anything. It changed my life.”</p><p align=justify>In December 2011, Hines began dating environmental attorney and anti-vaccination activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They announced their engagement late April 2014 and were married on August 2, 2014.</p><p>You may read full biography about Cheryl Hines from Wikipedia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfmLWmvtilZKGhnprAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcheryl-hines.html&text=Cheryl%20Hines%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcheryl-hines.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcheryl-hines.html&title=Cheryl%20Hines%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcheryl-hines.html&title=Cheryl%20Hines%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcheryl-hines.html&title=Cheryl%20Hines%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcheryl-hines.html&description=Cheryl%20Hines%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sarah-vaughan-19240327-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Vaughan (Jazz Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./purdue-student-adonis-tuggle-says-john-selke-used-excessive-force.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Purdue Student Adonis Tuggle Says John Selke Used Excessive Force">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
