Joking of course.</p><p>Then we move up to Heavyweight—traditionally an open-weight class, but not in MMA!&nbsp; For Heavyweight, we shoot up sixty pounds to a weight cap of&nbsp; 265.&nbsp; Why 60 lbs?&nbsp; I’ve got no idea, but it’s probably because 265 is a nice round number in some culture we’ve never heard of.&nbsp; Might have something to do with space aliens having 265 toes or something.&nbsp; Finally, we have our completely useless open-weight division called the&nbsp;Super-Heavyweight Division.&nbsp; This takes us directly to problem two.</p><p><strong>Problem Number Two: The Super-Heavyweight Division is a Failed Concept.</strong> &nbsp; The UFC doesn’t have this weight class.&nbsp; Neither does Strikeforce.&nbsp; Almost everyone doesn’t bother creating a Super-Heavyweight Division.&nbsp; Why do you think that is?&nbsp; Lets look at a few of the most noteworthy examples of the huge men that Super-Heavyweight was created for:<br>Bob Sapp (342 lbs)<br>Paulo César da "The Giant" Silva (385 lbs)<br>Hong Man-Choi (320 lbs)<br>Dan Bobish (330 lbs)<br>Zuluzinho (390 lbs)<br>Eric "Butterbean" Esch (416 lbs)<br>Jimmy Ambriz (315 lbs)</p><p>Now what all of these men have in common:<br>A.) They're probably too big to cut down to 265.<br>B.) Put them in against any top Heavyweight or even Light Heavyweight, and they will lose, guaranteed.&nbsp; Just look at their records if you doubt me.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, notable Super-Heavyweights with real fighting credentials and decent MMA records such as Semmy Schilt, Ron Waterman and Mark Hunt are all close enough in weight to make Heavyweight, no problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Heavyweight is a bizarre reversal of logic.&nbsp; People don’t fight at Super Heavyweight because they’re too big and too dominant for Heavyweights to handle.&nbsp; They fight at Super Heavyweights because they have no chance of winning against any world-class Heavyweight, or are too big to cut down to Heavyweight.&nbsp; Usually both are true.&nbsp; Life is just easier at Super Heavyweight.&nbsp;</p><p>I would suggest we don’t get rid of the Super Heavyweight division entirely.&nbsp; Instead, keep it as an option, but leave it on the back burner.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Maybe someday we’ll see a sudden influx of dominant 350+ pound fighters.&nbsp; Until that day comes, let’s put this utterly useless division to bed and let’s put your Hong Man-Choi’s and&nbsp; Zuluzinho’s back on the big stage known as the Heavyweight Division.&nbsp; It's certainly a lot of fun watching guys like Fedor and <a href=# title=Minowaman rel="noopener noreferrer">Minowaman</a> systematically destroy giant freaks of nature.&nbsp; Everybody wins!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Problem Number Three: MMA needs more title fights, and the fighters need more opportunities.</strong> &nbsp; The UFC is your most obvious promotion that desperately needs more champions.&nbsp; They put on between 10 and 15 Pay Per View events per year, but they only have five champions to spread around amongst those shows.&nbsp;</p><p>The average MMA fan wants a title fight for their $50, and they’re not getting it.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the UFC weight divisions get over-crowded and has to let go of a lot of fighters when they lose two or three fights in a row.&nbsp; This happens largely because a losing streak of two or three fights might drop them out of title contention indefinitely and the UFC needs room for prospects with title-fight potential.&nbsp; Younger promotions like Strikeforce are not in any dire need of more champions yet, but if they grow their business enough to survive, they’ll get there very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Problem Four: Overcrowded Weight Divisions.</strong> &nbsp; The UFC has a little too much depth at in pretty much every division.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Light Heavyweight is the most obvious example.&nbsp; Shogun, Rampage, and Rashad could all make a run at the title and stand a decent chance of slaying the Dragon.&nbsp; Then there is Thiago Silva, Brandon Vera, Randy Couture, Jon Jones, Ryan Bader—all looking for future title contention.&nbsp; Look at all the stars, past and present: Gegard Mousasi, Thiago Silva, <a href=#>Forrest Griffin</a>, Tito Ortiz, Little-Nog, Ricardo Arona, Rich Franklin, Keith Jardine, Dan Henderson, Chuck Liddell, Wanderlei Silva.&nbsp; Some are in the UFC, some might be at some future date.&nbsp; Some may go to Strikeforce and swell the ranks of&nbsp;that Light Heavyweight division.&nbsp; The overcrowded Light Heavyweight Division has more than enough talent and star-power to split it in two.&nbsp;</p><p>The same could be said of the UFC’s Lightweight, Welterweight and Middleweight divisions.&nbsp; There's room for expansion across the board!&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Here is what I would suggest:</strong><br>1.) Make the increments between weight classes consistent.<br>2.) Create one or two more weight classes.<br>3.) Eliminate the upper limit to Heavyweight unless and until we actually see giant men actually begin to dominate there.</p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li><strong>Strawweight &nbsp;&nbsp;120 lb &nbsp;57 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Flyweight &nbsp;&nbsp;130 lb &nbsp;61 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Bantamweight &nbsp;&nbsp;140 lb &nbsp;66 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Featherweight &nbsp;&nbsp;150 lb &nbsp;70 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Lightweight &nbsp;&nbsp;160 lb &nbsp;73 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Welterweight &nbsp;&nbsp;170 lb &nbsp;77 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Super Welterweight&nbsp;180 lb &nbsp;84 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Middleweight &nbsp;&nbsp;190 lb &nbsp;86 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Super Middleweight &nbsp;200 lb &nbsp;91 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Light Heavyweight &nbsp;210 lb &nbsp;95 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Cruiserweight &nbsp;&nbsp;220 lb &nbsp;100 kg</strong></li><li><strong>Heavyweight &nbsp;&nbsp;No upper weight limit</strong></li><li><strong>Super-Heavyweight</strong> (optional)&nbsp;<strong>Over&nbsp; 300 lb 136kg</strong>&nbsp; [Note: Super-Heavyweight can be instituted by a promotion if they choose.&nbsp; By so doing, a weight limit of 300 lbs/136 kg goes into effect for that promotions’ Heavyweight Division.]&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I think this effectively solves a lot of problems: The weight divisions are easy to keep track of and line up by even ten pound increments.&nbsp; Mixed martial arts fighters would have more opportunities, while their fans would get more title fights.&nbsp; The Heavyweight Division would once again mean what we think it means—it would be an open-weight division for the biggest, baddest fighters on the planet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXJoYmmEbq2Mq5yaq5%2BjrqO4xGapnpmcnrSvucSnq2anlmK6rq2MsJyin5ipeqS4wKyqnqs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html&text=A%20REASONABLE%20REALIGNMENT%20OF%20MMA%20WEIGHT%20CLASSES%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20Rumors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html&title=A%20REASONABLE%20REALIGNMENT%20OF%20MMA%20WEIGHT%20CLASSES%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html&title=A%20REASONABLE%20REALIGNMENT%20OF%20MMA%20WEIGHT%20CLASSES%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html&title=A%20REASONABLE%20REALIGNMENT%20OF%20MMA%20WEIGHT%20CLASSES%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f290247-a-reasonable-realignment-of-mma-weight-classes.html&description=A%20REASONABLE%20REALIGNMENT%20OF%20MMA%20WEIGHT%20CLASSES%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./corporate-branding-image-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corporate branding image">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tim-curry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Curry Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
