Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo were originally from Nigeria where they had their first child, Francis. They later relocated to Greece where they had the remaining of their four kids, Giannis included. The Antetokounmpo siblings went through several challenges, as the children of undocumented immigrants in Greece, before attaining success.

He is rather the third born and the middle child. Francis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo are older than him and he is older than Kostas and Alex Antetokounmpo.</p><h2><span><strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo Brothers Ages</strong></span></h2><p>The eldest of Giannis Antetokounmpo is 35-year old Francis Olowu Ofili Antetokounmpo. He was born on October 20, 1988. He is closely followed by 31-year-old Athanasios Rotimi Antetokounmpo, who was born on July 18, 1992.</p><p>His third brother, Konstantinos Ndubuisi Antetokounmpo, was born on November 20, 1997, and is 26 years old.

Francis was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, and is the only one among his siblings born and raised in the most populous country in Africa. According to records, he was born on the 20th of October 1988. This means that Francis is 35 years old right now.</p><p>About three years after Francis was born, his parents Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo resolved to leave Nigeria for Europe in search of a better life. As they were not certain what the future held for them in Europe, they decided to leave him behind when they left for Greece in 1991. Thus Francis was raised by his grandparents.</p><p>Like the rest of his siblings, Francis inherited his parents’ athletic genes. So he grew up and embraced soccer. It is said that Francis played professionally in Nigeria and then in Greece when he reunited with his family. However, it seems his days as a professional athlete are over. Francis Antetokounmpo is now pursuing a career as a music artist.

So to support his family, he led his younger brothers as they hawked in the streets of Athens.</p><p>Thannasis Antetokounmpo now makes a living as a professional basketball player. He plays in the NBA as a power/small forwards for the Milwaukee Bucks. His journey as a professional basketball player began in 2008 in Greece with the junior team of Filathlitikos.
