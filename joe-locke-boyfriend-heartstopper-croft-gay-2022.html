With a unique love story to light, the series 14-year-old Charlie as he develops feelings for popular rugby player Nick after the two bond over whether or not doing homework on the way to maths is suitable. The question remains; Is it a hit or a miss?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Adapted by <strong>Alice Oseman</strong> from her graphic novel series of the same name, consisting of eight episodes, the series premiered on April 22, 2022 and has been one of the most watched drama on recent days. As directed by <strong>Euros Lyn</strong>, the series follows the queer coming-of-age drama about queer identity, love, and friendship. The show, which is set in Truham Boys School and Higgs Girls School, focuses on queer people in same-sex schools and explores the politics of their existence while intricately presenting high-school romance.</p><p>Openly gay at his school, Charlie is treated as an outsider, thus being bullied every now and then. However, a twist in his fate occurs as he is seated next to Nick Nelson, the star rugby player. One thing leads to another and the two eventually fall in love against all odds. Alongside presenting a plethora of stories, exploring sexualities and subtly educating, the main focus of the drama remains on Charlie and Nick, and the nuances of their young gay loving hearts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span ez-l=under_second_paragraph ez-s=728x90,468x60,250x250,300x250,336x280,580x400 ez-ai=true ez-dt=ad></span><p>Reviewed as unutterably sweet and wholesome by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a>, the series received quite remarkable reviews to date.
