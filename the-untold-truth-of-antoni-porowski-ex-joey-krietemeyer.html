Krietemeyer is 32 years old and his zodiac sign is either Taurus or Gemini. He has a sister who works as an architect. He spent his formative years in Madeira, Ohio, and was a student of Drexel University. Joey is currently working as a Senior Art Director for 1stdibs.com.</p><p>Prior to starting this job, Joey wasn’t too interested in interior design, but that soon changed. He resides in New York and the aesthetic of his home includes brick walls, big windows and no curtains – the family prefers natural sunlight.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Krietemeyer dated Antoni Porowski for seven years, but their relationship fell through, and they went their separate ways. Their fans were saddened by the news – reportedly, they were very close and “basically married” as Porowski stated in an interview.</p><p>The actor credited his ex-boyfriend for helping him come out as gay to his family – he shared a heartfelt story about how he was on a ‘plane on the tarmac thinking that if the plane crashed his parents would never know that he’s gay, and it was then that the actor sent his father an email reading “I think it’s time I tell you: I love. I am loved. His name is Joey, and we live together.” He then said that his sexuality is something private and intimate, and isn’t something he’s ashamed of.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>After seven years, Antoni Porowski and Joey Krietemeyer have broken up and we just hope they're both practicing all the self care. <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/B3cMoQWRz0</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/M1eEfAiJXt</a></p><p>— E! News (@enews) <a rel=nofollow href=#>October 26, 2018</a></p><p>Krietemeyer hasn’t dated anyone publicly since the break-up, but Porowski was in a relationship with Trace Lehnhoff for a year, and as of today he’s with Kevin Harrington.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Krietemeyer shares some details from his private life on his social media account, and is followed by 56,000 people on Instagram. The designer often posts selfies and photos with his friends, but has no photos with his ex-boyfriend on that platform. Porowski has four million followers on the same network.</p><h2><span id=Ex-Boyfriend_Antoni_Porowski_Wiki>Ex-Boyfriend Antoni Porowski Wiki</span></h2><p>Born in Motreal, Quebec Canada on 14 March 1984, Antoni Porowski is best known as the chef, actor and TV personality who worked on “Queer Eye” and “The Blacklist”. He was born to Polish immigrants, and spent his formative years alongside his two sisters. Aged 12, his family moved to Glade Springs, West Virginia, and he spent the following years between those two places, before he returned permanently to Montreal. There, Porowski attended Marianopolis College and, after that was a student of the Concordia University, Montreal, from which he attained a BA degree in Creative Arts.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Antoni-View-Photo-1024x603.jpg></p><p>Antoni then moved to New York to pursue a career in entertainment. He studied at Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, and graduated in 2011. The actor is also an excellent chef – he credits his grandmother’s recipes for his outstanding cooking.</p><h2><span id=Antoni_Porowski_Career>Antoni Porowski Career</span></h2><p>Porowski <a rel=nofollow href=#>debuted in 2008</a> with a small role in “The Diary”, then in 2010 appeared in an episode of “Blue Mountain State”. In 2012, he appeared in the movie with an LGBT thematic, “Elliot Loves”. In 2014 the audience was able to see him in “The Blacklist”, and in 2016 in “Daddy’s Boy”.</p><p>As of 2018, Porowski joined the cast of “Horror Time”, working with Sara Silva and Shawn Thomas Diefenbach. In 2019 he had two big projects – “Taylor Swift: You Need to Calm Down” and “Queer Eye: We’re in Japan!”.</p><h2><span id=Queer_Eye>Queer Eye</span></h2><p>Broadcast on Netflix, “Queer Eye” is an American series and the reboot of Bravo’s series of the same name. The story revolves around five main characters as they head to Atlanta to help refine straight men’s diet, grooming, views and wardrobe.</p><p>It lived up to the expectations of the audience, being nominated for numerous awards, and rewarded with seven Primetime Emmy Awards as well as OFTA Television Award for Best Direction of a Reality or Non-Fiction Program and Best Writing of a Reality or Non-Fiction Program.</p><p>There were certain rumors about the relationships and friendships between cast members – some people believed they’re not getting along well.</p><p>Antoni’s co-star, Tan France let the fans take a sneak peek at their dynamics, and spoke about his first impression of Antoni, calling him incredibly handsome, but “not his type”. “He seemed like a nice guy, and I wanted him to get the job, but he had a nervous, shy energy about him and seemed way too sweet and angelic”, he then added. In the most recent season, the audience could see the “Fab Five” go international, visiting Japan, and focusing their business on another continent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmraCVYsKvwM6lm2asoqrBqXnOn2SapqSku6p5z6ipqK%2BjoLZusddmoaidqWK4s7XErZymnamav3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html&text=The%20Untold%20Truth%20Of%20Antoni%20Porowski%20Ex&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20Of%20Antoni%20Porowski%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20Of%20Antoni%20Porowski%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20Of%20Antoni%20Porowski%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-untold-truth-of-antoni-porowski-ex-joey-krietemeyer.html&description=The%20Untold%20Truth%20Of%20Antoni%20Porowski%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./january-24.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="January 24 Famous Birthdays - All Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./trade-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Trade>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
